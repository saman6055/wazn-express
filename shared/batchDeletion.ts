/**
 * When a batch may be deleted, and by whom.
 *
 * A batch created by mistake has to be undoable — wrong type, wrong
 * destination, parcels scanned into the wrong shipment. But a batch stops
 * being a mistake and starts being a record: once it has been invoiced,
 * boxed for delivery or tied to a full-package order, money has been counted
 * against it and deleting it would break arithmetic somebody has already
 * relied on.
 *
 * So three gates, in order of severity:
 *
 *   1. Money. If anything financial points at this batch, no one may delete
 *      it — not an admin, not a super admin, not on the first day. That is
 *      not a permission problem, and a bigger role does not make it safe.
 *
 *   2. Time. Inside the first day it is still plausibly a mistake, and an
 *      admin may undo it. After that nobody may — not an admin, not a super
 *      admin. A day-old batch has been scanned into, looked at and worked
 *      from; by then deleting it is not correcting a mistake, it is removing
 *      a record, and the escalation path only ever made that easier to do.
 *
 *   3. Parcels. Packages scanned into the batch do NOT block it. They are
 *      released back to unassigned and survive the deletion — that is the
 *      whole case the feature exists for. They are counted here only so the
 *      warning can say how many are about to be released.
